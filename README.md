ROM - A dead-simple Redis Object Mapper
=======================================

A super flexible Redis Object Mapper. It's all about model method DRY-ness.


Usage
-----

Using rom is very easy!

    var rom = require('rom');
    var client = require('redis').createClient();
    // Name your database and pass the redis client.
    var db = rom.createDatabase('myDatabase', client);
    // Or you can just let rom pick-up your redis client automatically
    // var db = rom.createDatabase('myDatabase');

    // Define your model and its methods.
    var User = db.Model.extend('user', {
        defaults: {
            first_name: "My First Name",
            last_name: "My Last Name"
        },
        fullName: function() {
            return this.get('first_name') + " " + this.get('last_name');
        },
        hello: function() {
            return "Hello, " + this.fullName() + "."
        }
    });

    // Create an instance
    var user = User({first_name: "John", last_name: "Doe"});

    // Save your model
    user.save();  // Returns the local state.
                  // You can get the db state by passing a callback.

    // Call your method!
    user.hello();  // "Hello, John Doe."


Installation
------------

Using npm:

    npm install rom
